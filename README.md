Recent Improvements
PocketFlow Integration
The core agent logic has been refactored to use PocketFlow, a lightweight and expressive framework for building LLM applications. This change significantly improves the modularity, maintainability, and scalability of the agent logic. The new implementation is based on PocketFlow's `Node`, `Flow`, and `Shared Store` concepts.

Functional MCP Servers and Tools
The MCP (ModuMind Control Plane) servers are now functional. Their status is fetched from a new API endpoint, providing real-time information.
The agent tools are now fully integrated with the agent logic. Users can select a tool when delegating a task, and the tool is executed as part of the task processing flow.

File Uploads
The chat interface now supports file uploads. Users can upload files of various types (pdf, txt, md, code files), and the file content is made available to the agent as part of the task context.

Enhanced Learning System
Adaptive behavior profiles that adjust based on agent performance
Vector database integration for long-term knowledge retention
Experience-based threshold adjustment for better decision-making
LLM Integration Flexibility
Support for both local and commercial LLM endpoints
Per-agent LLM configuration allowing specialized AI models
Prompt injection capabilities for customized agent behavior
Collaborative Decision Framework
Multi-agent consensus mechanisms
Human oversight integration
Detailed decision tracking and analysis
Tool Ecosystem
Modular tool system with category-based organization
Simulated tool execution with realistic results
Tool usage analytics integrated with learning system
Database Optimization
PostgreSQL with JSONB support for flexible data storage
Efficient embedding storage for vector operations
Automated migration system

Refactoring `agentLogic.ts` with PocketFlow
The `agentLogic.ts` file has been refactored to use PocketFlow. The original `processAgentTask` function has been replaced by a PocketFlow `Flow` that orchestrates a series of `Nodes`. Each node represents a specific step in the task processing logic, such as making a decision, executing a tool, or handling a failure. This new architecture makes the agent logic more explicit, easier to debug, and more flexible to extend.
This system represents a comprehensive AI agent platform that combines hierarchical task management, adaptive learning, flexible LLM integration, and robust decision-making capabilities in a modern, scalable architecture.



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
